# Next.js App with Prisma

Welcome to the Next.js App with Prisma project! ðŸš€
[Open app on Vercel](https://nextjs-prisma-postgresql-two.vercel.app/)

This project is a result of diving into the fantastic world of Next.js through Stephen Grider's comprehensive course on Udemy, titled [Next JS: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-the-complete-developers-guide/). This course provided invaluable insights and hands-on experience in building powerful web applications using Next.js.

## Overview

The primary focus of this project is to showcase the development journey outlined in Stephen Grider's course. To enhance deployment capabilities, I've adapted the original project to use Vercel as the hosting platform. Additionally, the database backend has been transitioned from SQLite to PostgreSQL for improved scalability and performance.
